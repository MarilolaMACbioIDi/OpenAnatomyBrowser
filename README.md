# Project Description
The main objective of this project is to use the open anatomy browser as a training platform for everyone, including developing countries. In the first place, we plan its adaptation to different languages and study its functionality to import/export data in order to facilitate the communication between both platforms (OpenAnatomy and Slicer). 

## Objective

1. To define a strategy to follow in order to tackle i18n and L10n Oabrowser projects
1. To study how to import/export data from/to 3DSlicer/Oabrowser/Others
1. Create a prototype with both projects (i18n-L10n and import/export)

## Approach and Plan

1. Study the framework and modules of oabrowser (try to solve every possible question)
1. Review other examples
1. Investigate additional features to validate the prototypes 

## Progress and Next Steps

1. The study to import/export data from/to 3DSlicer/Oabrowser is already done and there is a prototype of the module.
1. Athough the prototype could be used to define a strategy, still we are working in the definition
<!-- But in this prototype still we must consider the use of the information of label maps. We are working on this.-->
